This is a personal project for me.  I don't really have much that I would like to share here in the README.md.  I hope that you like what I am doing.

My site is devoted to Rails, Ruby, HTML5, CSS3, AND Sass.

Enjoy.

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
